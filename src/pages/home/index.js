      <p>
        I'm Mike, a software engineer based in Baltimore, MD, USA.
        I love taking new ideas and bringing them to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a multitude of interests ranging from hardware and software engineering, to music, to cooking, to video games.
        In addition to details about my professional history, this site is a repository of ideas and knowledge I wish to retain for myself and share with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm passionate about conveying knowledge in an accessible and intuitive way.
        It's my hope that if you come across something on this site that is of interest, you walk away with a better understanding of that something.
      </p>

        If you'd like to speak to me about software, music, computers, or something else, <a href="mailto:hello@miska.me" class="text-surf">drop me a line</a>!
        Additionally, if there's something on this site that needs work (or that you think should be on this site but isn't), I'd love to hear from you.
