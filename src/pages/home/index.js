          I'm Mike, a creative engineer based in Baltimore, MD, USA.
          I love taking new ideas and bringing them to life.

          I have a multitude of interests like hardware and software engineering, music, audio/video/lighting production, video games, and more.
          In addition to details about my professional history, this site is a repository of ideas and knowledge I wish to retain for myself and share with others.
